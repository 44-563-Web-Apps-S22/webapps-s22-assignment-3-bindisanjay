    <h2>Area of Simple Polygon</h2>
    <blockquote>In geometry, a simple polygon /ˈpɒlɪɡɒn/ is a polygon that does
        not intersect itself and has no holes. That is, it is a flat shape consisting of
        straight, non-intersecting line segments or "sides" that are joined pairwise to 
        form a single closed path. If the sides intersect then the polygon is not simple.
        The qualifier "simple" is frequently omitted, with the above definition then being 
        understood to define a polygon in general.<br>
